/*

	program counter tells the CPU where in memory it can find the next instruction.


	virtual machine is a computer built with software.

	why ?

	context of building virtual machine that it should build be able to
	execute all possible and not just build in functions.


	so context is we are going to translate our cx program into instructions
	for a virtual machine and the virtual machine itself runs on as many architectures
	as its implemetintation languages



	a virtual machine has a run loop that goes through
	the fetch-decode-excute cycle.


	its feches the instructions pointed by program counter ; it decodes and excutes y.



		dispatching virtual machine means selecting an implementation for an instruction
		before executing





		what exactly virtual machine execute ?
		bytecode

		bytecode is made of instructionss that tells the machine what to do.


		its is called bytecode because opcode contained in each instruction are
		one byte in size.


		opcode is the "operator part of an instruction
