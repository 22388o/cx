CX Build Tools
==============

This directory contains tools that is of use for developers of CX.

BUILD.sh
--------

At this time, the only tool available is a build script that builds CX from
scratch and installs it into the Golang binary directory. For this to work,
the original setup of CX using cx.sh on Linux/Unix or cx-setup.bat on Windows
has to be run first.

It is noteworthy that BUILD.sh supports building from any CX source directory,
i.e. also from a forked repo of the skycoin/cx repo on GitHub.  The setup
script (cx.sh or cx-setup.bat) explicitly always builds from the skycoin/cx
repository so it cannot be used for developers working on any other
repository.

To use the build script, stand in the CX top directory and just type

 sh BUILD.sh

and a version of CX build from the source tree will be built and
installed. Note that the GOPATH environment variable needs to be set
beforehand for the installation to work correctly.
