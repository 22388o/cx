%% Note, this is used to generate stdmod.tex.  The bindings could be
%% extracted automatically from the document, but this lets us choose
%% the ordering and optionally format manually where needed.

This section lists the exports provided by the standard libraries.  The
libraries are factored so as to separate features which might not be
supported by all implementations, or which might be expensive to load.

\textbf{Base Library}

\begin{scheme}
{\cf *}                       {\cf +}
{\cf -}                       {\cf ...}
{\cf /}                       {\cf <}
{\cf <=}                      {\cf =}
\end{scheme}

\textbf{Case-Lambda Library}

The \texttt{(scheme case-lambda)} library exports the {\cf case-lambda}
syntax.

\begin{scheme}
{\cf case-lambda}
\end{scheme}

\textbf{Char Library}

The \texttt{(scheme char)} library provides the procedures for dealing with
characters that involve potentially large tables when supporting all of Unicode.

\begin{scheme}
{\cf char-alphabetic?\ }       {\cf char-ci<=?}
{\cf char-ci<?\ }              {\cf char-ci=?}
\end{scheme}
