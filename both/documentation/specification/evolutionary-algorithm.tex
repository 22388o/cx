\chapter{Standard Feature Identifiers}
\label{stdfeatures}

An implementation may provide any or all of the feature identifiers
listed below for use by {\cf cond-expand} and {\cf features},
but must not provide a feature identifier if it does not
provide the corresponding feature.  

\label{standard_features}

\feature{r7rs}{All \rsevenrs\ Scheme implementations have this feature.}
\feature{exact-closed}{All algebraic operations except {\cf /} produce
  exact values given exact inputs.}
\feature{exact-complex}{Exact complex numbers are provided.}
